###DYNAMICS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS ON INVARIANT MANIFOLDS

The simplification resulting from reduction of dimension involved in the study of invariant manifolds of differential equations is often difficult to achieve in practice. Appropriate coordinate systems are difficult to find or are essentially local in nature thus complicating analysis of global dynamics. Li and Muldowney [8] developed an approach that avoids the selection of coordinate systems on the manifold. Conditions were given for the stability of equilibria and periodic orbits in terms of stability of compound equations of the linearized systems at the equilibrium or periodic orbit. When the manifold is a finite dimensional Euclidean space, results in [11] and [7] show that if these conditions are satisfied by the linearized system at any bounded orbit, then the omega limit set is respectively an equilibrium or a periodic orbit. The thesis provides a survey of these topics and develops a new approach that extends the results on the existence of equilibria and periodic orbits to systems with invariant manifolds.

###Reverse time migration for converted waves and anisotropic media

Low-order finite-difference solutions to the acoustic wave equation require fine time and space sampling to avoid dispersion and instability. We consider the time-stepping of a wavefield using a phase shift in the wavenumber domain in order to use coarser time and grid sampling. Unlike finite-differencing, for homogeneous media the phase- shift time-stepping method is exact and displays no dispersion or instability if an aliasing condition is met. For heterogeneous media, we develop a windowed Fourier approximation or interpolation that is an approximate propagator with minimal numerical artifacts. We demonstrate the potential of our method by performing prestack reverse-time migration of the Marmousi dataset and by a simple forward modelling example. The phase-shift time-stepping method can also be adapted to anisotropic media by substituting a variable isotropic velocity with approximations to the dispersion relation for anisotropic media. The dispersion relation relates the frequency to the wavenumbers in the Fourier domain.
